# *lazmacropad* - a Macro Keypad

**Version 0.8.0**

This project describes a rudimentary macro keypad serially connected to a computer. The keypad is continuously scanned by a microcontroller (an Arduino Nano) which transmits a single letter string or *message* ('0', '1', ...) identifying the pressed key. These *messages* are translated into macros by Lazarus/Free Pascal program running in the background. When the macro is a string it is copied to the system clipboard and then an emulated key combination (Ctrl+V, Shift+Insert...) is injected into the keyboard event queue of the active application to paste the content of the clipboard. Starting with version 0.8.0 is possible to bypass the clipboard and to inject a macro consisting of an array of keyboard events instead.

The Lazarus program also allows for editing, saving and loading macro definitions to suit any number of applications on the desktop.

There is a [post about this project](https://sigmdel.ca/michel/program/fpl/macrokeypad/basic_macrokeypad_fr.html) which contains a draft *user manual*. It is an incomplete draft currently available in French only.

**Warning:**  Version 0.8.0 has only been used in Linux Mint 20.1 using the GTK2 widget set. Its first implementation of macros consisting of keyboard events only is a proof of concept and needs considerable reworking. Older versions the macro keypad program were tested and found to run on Linux Mint 20.1 Mate, Mint 21 Mate and Windows 10 although there are some limitations as described below.

**If the microcontroller is running an older version of the Arduino sketch, it must be replaced with the newer version released in v0.7.2** (see [6. Accommodating Different Keypads](#6-accommodating-different-keypads)).


As of version 0.6.0, *lazmacropad* is a tray application. [Version 0.3.4](releases/tag/v0.3.4) was the last released of the project that featured a normal program.

## 1. Hardware

Only three items are needed to build a basic macro keypad:

  1. A switch matrix. The program assumes that the key pad is composed of 16 switches arranged in a 4 x 4 matrix.

  2. An Arduino Nano R3. This is an older, smaller, Arduino board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. It has a Mini-B USB socket, but some clones come with a Micro or Type-C USB connector.

  3. An appropriate USB cable to connect the Nano to a desktop or portable computer.

Basically, any development board with 8 digital I/O pins and a serial port could be used, but the Nano and the readily available 4x4 tactile push button matrix shown below are very easily connected to each other.

![hardware](images/macrokeypad.jpg)

Note that the Nano is upside down (microcontroller is on the hidden side of the board) so that the USB cable will go off to the right. The Nano could be connected facing in the other direction by flipping it right side up if it is more convenient to orient the cable towards the left. The character transmitted over the serial port as of each key is pressed and the mapping of the Nano I/O pins should be modified in the Arduino sketch running on the Nano. 

## 2. Source Code and Prerequisites

[nanoMacroPad.ino](nanoMacroPad/nanoMacroPad.ino) contains the Arduino sketch that runs on the Nano. It requires the [Keypad library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad/) ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad)) by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig. It can be installed with the Arduino IDE library manager.

The source code of the *lazmacropad* object pascal program is in the root directory of the repository. The [images](images/) directory contains the two images shown on this page. Neither of these are required to compile the program. 

The [`MouseAndKeyInput`](https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/MouseAndKeyInput) unit is used to generate the desired paste keyboard shortcut. The unit is found in the `lazmouseandkeyinput.lpk` non-visual package. That package is in the `$(LAZARUS)/components/mouseandkeyinput` directory. Load the package file into the Lazarus IDE and compile it. Add `lazmouseandkeyinput` to the `Required Packages` in the `Project Inspector` window (which is opened from the `Project` menu in the IDE).

### 2.1. Linux Requirements

#### 2.1.1. `Xtst` Library

The `Xtst` library is required by the `lazmouseandkeyinput.lpk` package. In recent versions of Debian, the package containing this library is called `libxtst6` and it is probably included in most Debian-based desktop distributions. This is the case for Linux Mint 20.1 Mate and Mint 21 Mate. Should the library be missing, it can be installed in the usual fashion.

```bash
$ apt install libxtst6
```

Although the library was installed in Mint 20.1, it could not be found because of a missing symbolic link to `libXtst.so`. 

```bash
$ locate libXtst
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXtst.so.6
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXtst.so.6.1.10
```

In that case, add the symbolic link and update the library database.

```bash
$ cd /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
$ sudo ln -s libXtst.so.6.1.0 libXtst.so
$ sudo updatedb
```

The directory in which are stored system libraries are stored is not necessarily called `/usr/lib/x85_64-linux-gnu` so adust the above in accordance with the output obtained from the `locate` command.

It appears some have been installing the development package `libxtst-dev` in a bid to add the missing symbolic link, but there is no need for that. 


#### 2.1.2. `xKeyInput.pas` Bug Fix

Chances are the program will work, except in some *older* distributions. An unending sequence of key-down events can be generated by the injected paste key combination. Those virtual key down events will continue until a key on the physical keyboard is pressed. As it happens, Mint 20.1 released in January 2021 (an LTS version valid until 2025) and Mint 21 only recently release are among those *older* distributions. The solution to that problem is to change the type of the `is_press` argument in the `XTestFakeKeyEvent` function to `Boolean32` instead of `Boolean`. The function is in the file `$(lazarus)/components/mouseandkeyinput/xkeyinput.pas`. The problem and solution were provided by bytesbites in an August 16, 2016 [forum post](https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,33719.msg218852.html#msg218852). See issues [27819](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/lazarus/lazarus/-/issues/27819) and [39964](https://gitlab.com/freepascal.org/lazarus/lazarus/-/issues/39964) in the Lazarus Gitlab repository.


#### 2.1.3. Serial USB Device Problem in Mint 21 and Ubuntu 22.04

The serial device, usually `dev ttyUSB0` on my systems, would not be created on connection of the Nano to the desktop in Mint 21 and Ubuntu 22.04. That was unusual because the USB device was found.

```bash
michel@hp:~$ lsusb
...
Bus 003 Device 006: ID 1a86:7523 QinHeng Electronics HL-340 USB-Serial adapter
... 
```

That means that the Arduino IDE could not be used to flash the sketch on the Nano nor could a flashed macro keypad work with those systems. The following log entry provided a hint as to the cause of the problem.
  
```
usbfs: interface 0 claimed by ch34x while 'brltty' sets config #1 #18 
```

A quick search yielded a couple of **StackExchange** queries ([Unable to use [...] on USB-serial converter chip](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/670636/unable-to-use-usb-dongle-based-on-usb-serial-converter-chip) and [On Linux Min21, unable to access tools/port...)](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/90954/on-linux-min21-unable-to-access-tools-port-grayed-out) and a blog post ([Solved: brltty â€“ USB COM Port Gets Immediately Disconnected](https://lynxbee.com/solved-brltty-usb-com-port-gets-immediately-disconnected/#.Y20o5ZCZNhE)). It seems that the screen reader [BRLTTY](https://brltty.app/) is now enabled by default and it takes over the serial port which I assume would be connected to a Braille display.

There are two ways to "resolve" the situation: disable the service as explained in the first two references or remove the `brltty` package altogether with the usual `apt remove brltty` command as explained in the last reference. Unfortunately, this is not a working solution for those that need the screen reader.  

#### 2.1.4. Compiler Versions and Linux Widgetsets

The program was developed in Linux Mint 20.1 Mate using Lazarus 2.3.0 (rev main-2_3-1602-gdb285860e3) FPC 3.3.1 x86_64-linux-gtk2. The resulting GTK2 binary runs without limitations in Linux Mint 20.1 and Mint 21.

The source code was also compiled in Mint 21 using a slightly more recent, trunk version, of the compiler: Lazarus 2.3.0 (rev main-2_3-2735-g4628b33d4a) FPC 3.3.1 x86_64-linux-qt5. The target widget toolkit was set to Qt5 instead of the "default" GTK2 widget set. This required installing `libqt5pas1_2.10xxxx` and `libqt5pas-dev_2.10xxxx` libraries by David Bannon (Davo aka dbannon on the Lazarus forum) from his [Github repository](https://github.com/davidbannon/libqt5pas) instead of the `libqt5pas` and `libqt5pas-dev` from the Debian repository. The program compiled for that widget set does work when using Ctrl+V as the paste shortcut, but pasting macros with the Shift+Insert shortcut fails. Consequently, until a solution is found, a Qt5 version of the program will not be released.

### 2.2. Windows Requirements

The source was compiled and tested with two versions of Lazarus in Windows 10:

- stable: Lazarus 2.2.4 (rev lazarus_2_2_4) FPC 3.2.2 i386-win32-win32/win64
- trunk: Lazarus 2.3.0 (rev main-2_3-2734-g2f18817fd8) FPC 3.3.1 i386-win32-win32/win64

There are cosmetic problems with the macro definition screen with the binary generated with the stable version of the compiler. The maximum column width of the first column is not respected. While there is a work around, it is not included in the source code because that bug has been removed in the trunk version of the compiler. Because it is a bit more difficult to install the trunk version of the compiler, Windows binaries compiled with the trunk version of the compiler are supplied in the [0.6.0 release](https://github.com/sigmdel/lazmacropad/releases/tag/v0.6.0). Binaries for the latest release are upcoming.

Note: The Windows version of the `Serial` unit does have a serial connection status variable. Consequently, there will be a log message about a lost connection when running in Windows. Furthermore, selection of the clipboard paste command used internally by the program is ignored in the Windows version. 

## 3. Macros

There are two types of macros:

  - Strings (UTF8) that are copied to the clipboard and pasted into an application.
  - Arrays of keyboard events

The UTF8 strings can contain 3 escape sequences

  -  `\n` will be converted to #13 (RETURN)
  -  `\t` will be converted to #9  (TAB)
  -  `\\` will be converted to `\`

Appending a `\n` sequence to a macro to be used in the terminal will mean that it will be executed as soon as the corresponding key is pressed. This could be used to start a program. Be careful, some programs such as the Arduino IDE can grab the serial port and, as a result, *lazmacropad* freezes.

Macros 0 and 1, in the macro definition window shown in the image below, both inject `hello`  into the currently focused application on the computer running *lazmacropad*. 

![](images/macro_defs.jpg)

Note how each key down event (â†“) must be followed by a corresponding key up event (â†‘) otherwise the operating system will generate a sequence of autorepeat key down events. The same applies to the Shift, Ctrl and Alt modifier keys. Macros 2 and 3 are similar to the first two except that they insert the uppercase string `HELLO` followed by a carriage return. Note how the Shift modifier was activated with the `H` key and deactivated with the `O` key, just as most would keep the shift key depressed when entering a few uppercase characters at a keyboard.

Note also that the virtual keyboard events injected into the keyboard event queue will be translated according to the keyboard layout in current use. So if the layout is the ISO French AZERTY keyboard, then the sequence `(â†“ 2[])(â†‘ 2[])(â†“ 7[])(â†‘ 7[])` will insert `Ã©Ã¨` in the focused application. How this is done with an ANSI US (QWERTY) keyboard is not at all clear. Because the `Alt Gr` key is not yet implemented in *lazmacropad*, it is not possible to copy `Ã´` or `Ã«` etc. into the focused application with a keyboard event macro. Of course, it is easy to do with a string macro.

## 4. Clipboards and Paste Commands

The GNOME terminal emulator and its forks such as the MATE terminal do not support the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V key combinations, which makes sense since Ctrl+C is used to cancel a running program. On the other hand, it is possible to paste the primary selection in the terminal with Shift+Insert or Shift+Ctrl+V. Consequently, a string macro is copied into the clipboard, *lazmacropad* also copies it into the primary selection. This is pretty much the behaviour of many applications (Geany, VSCodium, VS Code, GNote, LibreOffice Writer and the Lazarus IDE editor,... ), which synchronize the two mechanisms by pasting selected text with Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert.

Each macro must be assigned a `Paste Command` from the following list:

  1. `Ctrl+V`              
  2. `Shift+Insert`
  3. `Custom`    (currently `Shift+Ctrl+V`)
  4. `None`
  5. `Kbd Events`

If the last command is selected, then the macro must be an array of keyboard events. The first four paste commands then the corresponding macro is assumed to be a string that will be copied into the clipboard and primary selection. If one of the first three commands is used, then the corresponding keyboard event will be injected into the keyboard event queue and, presumably, the currently focused application will respond by pasting the clipboard or primary selection. If the `None` paste command is specified, the only thing *lazmacropad* does is to copy the macro into the clipboard.

If a string macro ends with the sequence '\n' and the Shift+Insert combination is used for the paste operation then it will be executed as a command if inserted at a terminal prompt. A program could be launched or a script could be executed by pressing a single key (#).  Care must be taken when running programs, as some, such as the Arduino IDE, may seize the serial port and, as a result, *lazmacropad* freezes. 

> ~~(#) While this works well in Mint 20.1 with GTK2, it does not seem to work at all times in Mint 21 even after latest (v0.7.4) "improvement" in handling the trailing '\n'. However these tests are being done in a virtual machine which may have some impact.~~ 

> (#) This works well in Mint 20.1 using GTK2. Cursory tests of *lazmacropad* (GTK2) in a LiveUSB version of Mint 21 MATE, showed that the v0.7.4 handling of trailing '\n' when using Shift+Insert does work as expected. Why this does not work in a virtual machine is not clear.

There is no primary selection in Windows but Shift+Insert does work just as Ctrl+V when used from the physical keyboard. So far, injecting Shift+Insert in Windows has not worked. ~~Consequently *lazmacropad* uses Ctrl+V no matter what keyboard shortcut is specified when it is running in Windows.~~

## 5. Accommodating Different Keypads

With version 0.7.2, *lazmacropad* can handle keypads with up to 36 keys. The number of rows and columns must be specified in the configuration file. Open the log and parameters windows. Make sure that the `Log Level` is set to `Information` or `Debug` and then click on the `Save Configuration` button. The full path of the configuration file, `options.ini`, will be displayed in the log. Close *lazmacropad*, the edit the `[keypad]` section of the configuration file, specifying the number of columns and rows in the key matrix.

```ini
[keypad]
cols=3
rows=5
```

The default values are 4 columns and 4 rows as before. Some changes had to be made to Arduino sketch which means that the modified version will have to be uploaded to the microcontroller. The 36 key limit is arbitrary and should one wanted to have an even bigger keypad then all that needs to be done is to add characters to the SKeyLabels resource string  in `keymap.pas` and adjust the `hexaKeys` array of chars in the Arduino sketch in a similar fashion. In any case, other values must be adjusted in the Arduino sketch: `ROWS`, `COLS` and the byte arrays `rowPins` and `colPins`.

When *lazmacropad* is restarted, it will display the correct number of macros and the keymap will be adjusted to reflect the keypad matrix size. 

## 6. Acknowledgment

There is no shortage of information on all sorts of more or less sophisticated macro key pads. The Brian Lough video, [The Simplest DIY Macro Keypad with Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORujXGDqG_I&ab_channel=BrianLough) and corresponding [GitHub repository, arduino-switcheroonie,](https://github.com/witnessmenow/arduino-switcheroonie) stands out for its simplicity, but that project is based on an Arduino Pro Micro. The Cristian Bastidas (crixodia) [arduino-nano-macro-keypad](https://github.com/crixodia/arduino-nano-macro-keypad) GitHub repository showed how to achieve something very similar  with a Nano and a Python script on the desktop. This later project is clearly the model for *lazmacropad*.
